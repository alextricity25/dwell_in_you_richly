"Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to God." - Colossians 3:16

Sinks
#####

Sinks, in the context of this program, collect all the data returned
by the engine, then perform further actions on that data. The
emphasis is that they perform actions on all the data as a whole. 
They do not operate on data from the engine on an item-by-item
basis.

For example, the shuffle sink collects all the data from the engine
iterable, then operates on that lump data by shuffling it.
